      Hi! This is the friendly automated conda-forge-linting service.
      
      I wanted to let you know that I linted all conda-recipes in your PR (```meta.yaml```) and found some lint.
      
      Here's what I've got...
      
      
      For **meta.yaml**:
      
       * Failed to even lint the recipe, probably because of a conda-smithy bug :cry:. This likely indicates a problem in your `meta.yaml`, though. To get a traceback to help figure out what's going on, install conda-smithy and run `conda smithy recipe-lint .` from the recipe directory.
